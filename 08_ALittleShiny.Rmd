# A Little Shiny

Like we promised, students will be able to input their personal information and get a list of colleges and universities ranked top according to our **fitness index** system.

(In that way, Zuofu could pretend that there's such person **Zafo** with a 1580 SAT and want to go to a big school in the city.)

## Shiny App

We are still working on it! 

```{R eval = FALSE}
#build the server
server4 <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  
  
}


#build the user interface
ui4 <- fluidPage(
  headerPanel("Choose your inputs"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
          selectInput("schoolsize",label = "School Size:", choices = c("0-1000","1000-1800","1800-2500","2500+"), multiple = TRUE),
          numericInput("sat", label = "Input your SAT score:", min = 0, max = 1600, step = NA),
          selectInput("region", label = "Select off regions:", choices = c("NewEngland","MidEast","GreatLakes","Plains","Southeast","Southwest","RockyMountains","FarWest","NA"), multiple = TRUE),
          selectInput("location", label = "Geographical Location:", choices = c("City","Suburb","Town","Rural")),
          numericInput("cost", label = "Input your ideal cost/yr:", min = 0, max = 100000, step = NA),
          numericInput("diversity", label = "Input your ideal school racial diversity:", min = 0, max = 1, step = 0.01)
        ),
        mainPanel(
          h4("fitnessIndex"),
          tableOutput("output_table"),
          h4("List of Schools"),
          tableOutput("output_table2")
        )
    )
)

shinyApp(ui = ui4, server = server4)

```
